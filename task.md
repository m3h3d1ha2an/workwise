## **Task Title: Smart Task Manager**

Build a simple web app to manage **projects, teams, and tasks**.  
 Users can assign tasks to team members, track workload capacity, and balance tasks using a **“Reassign Tasks”** button.

## **1\. User & Team Setup**

* Users can **register and log in**.  
* Each user can **create teams** and **add members manually** (no email needed).  
* Each team member has:  
  * **Name**  
  * **Role**  
  * **Capacity** (0–5 tasks they can handle comfortably)

## **2\. Project & Task Management**

* Users can:  
  * **Create projects** and link them to a specific team.  
  * **Add tasks** under a project.  
* Each task includes:  
  * **Title**  
  * **Description**  
  * **Assigned Member** (from project’s team or “Unassigned”)  
  * **Priority:** Low / Medium / High  
  * **Status:** Pending / In Progress / Done  
* Users can **Add, Edit, Delete**, and **Filter** tasks by Project or Member.

## **3\. Task Assignment Flow**

* When creating a task:  
  1. Select the **Project** (and team auto-links).  
  2. Choose an **Assigned Member** from the team (dropdown).  
  3. Show each member’s **(currentTasks / capacity)** beside their name.  
  4. If a member is already over capacity, show a **warning**, e.g.:  
      Riya has 4 tasks but capacity is 3\. Assign anyway?  
     * Options: **\[Assign Anyway\]** or **\[Choose Another\]**  
  5. Optionally click **“Auto-assign”** to pick the member with the least load.

## **4\. Auto Reassignment**

When user clicks **“Reassign Tasks”**:

1. Check if any member has more tasks than their capacity.  
2. Move extra tasks to members with free capacity.  
3. **Rules:**  
   * Keep **High Priority** tasks with current assignee.  
   * Only move **Low** and **Medium** priority tasks.  
4. Update assigned members automatically.  
5. Record all changes in the **Activity Log**.

## **5\. Dashboard**

Show:

* **Total Projects**  
* **Total Tasks**  
* **Team Summary:** Each member’s current tasks vs. capacity (mark red if overloaded)  
* **“Reassign Tasks”** button  
* **Recent Reassignments:** Last 5 moved tasks

## **6\. Activity Log**

* Record each reassignment, e.g.:  
   10:30 AM — Task “UI Design” reassigned from Riya to Farhan.  
* Show the **latest 5–10 logs** on the dashboard (newest first).
